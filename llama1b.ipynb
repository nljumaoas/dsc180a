    "## Training Setup with Hugging Face Trainer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we configure the training parameters and initialize the Hugging Face Trainer for our model. The `Trainer` class provides a high-level API that simplifies the training loop and integrates various components needed for model training and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Arguments**: We define `TrainingArguments`, which includes essential parameters such as:\n",
    "  - `output_dir`: Directory where the model predictions and checkpoints will be saved.\n",
    "  - `num_train_epochs`: Total number of training epochs, we use 3 here to match up with llama\n",
    "  - `per_device_train_batch_size`: Batch size per device (GPU/TPU) during training.\n",
    "  - `learning_rate`: The initial learning rate for the optimizer.\n",
    "  - `evaluation_strategy`: Strategy to evaluate the model during training (e.g., after a set number of steps, set to 20 here but can also be updated to after each epoch).\n",
    "  - `weight_decay`: Strength of weight decay to apply during training to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "  - `report_to`: Report loss and other metrics to weights and bias for real time tracking of the plot.\n",
    "  - `logging_dir`: Directory for storing logs.\n",
    "  - `fp16`: Allows mixed precision training to save memory cost and improve efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trainer Initialization**: We create an instance of the `Trainer` class by passing the model, training arguments, and datasets. The `Trainer` handles the training loop, loss computation, gradient updates, and evaluation automatically, making it easier to focus on model development rather than the intricacies of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use Hugging Face Trainer here because it implifies the training workflow by abstracting repetitive tasks, supports mixed-precision training and distributed training across multiple GPUs with minimal configuration, and provides built-in evaluation metrics and logging capabilities for monitoring model performance. This setup will allow us to efficiently train our language model, leveraging the power of Hugging Face's libraries and tools."
